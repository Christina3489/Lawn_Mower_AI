Autonomous Lawn Mower Using Reinforcement Learning

This project focuses on developing an autonomous Lawn Mower Agent using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to efficiently navigate and maintain large, grid-based lawns while avoiding obstacles.

Overview
Maintaining lawns in complex environments is labor-intensive and inefficient with traditional methods. This project leverages the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to automate the process, allowing the agent to:

Navigate a grid-based lawn.
Mow grass efficiently.
Avoid obstacles.
Core Technology
Reinforcement Learning (DQN): Combines Q-learning with deep neural networks for decision-making in high-dimensional environments.
Experience Replay and Target Networks: Techniques to improve learning stability and performance.
Features
Efficient lawn coverage with minimized energy usage and revisits.
Ability to operate autonomously without human intervention.
Grid-based simulation to test agent behavior in environments with obstacles.
Performance
After fine-tuning parameters, the agent achieves efficient lawn coverage within 300+ steps, making the solution scalable and suitable for residential and commercial applications.

Goal
To demonstrate how reinforcement learning can automate real-world tasks, enhancing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability in lawn maintenance.
